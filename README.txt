Question no. 2
Question 2
Write a “sign up” program for a user that asks the user to enter a username and a password. This login and password are written into a file in the following format:
username1,password1
username2,password2
username3,password3
...
Handle special cases like the username entered already exists in the file then it should inform user that the username entered already exists and prompt the user to choose another username. The file where it needs to be written must be passed from the command line.

This application has been upgraded. The program now has a requirement for an additional
column called “name”. The user will enter another entry called “name” along with username,
password as it did previously. The name field need not be unique in the file. Assume it is just the
first name, without any spaces, and the file will contain the entries in the following format:
username1,password1,name1
username2,password2,name2
username3,password3,name3

I am submitting a c file with the code written.It takes 3 inputs from the user and upgraded.
